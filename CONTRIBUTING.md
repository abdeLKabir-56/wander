## Suggesting Features

We welcome new ideas for features or improvements! To suggest a feature, please:

Our team will review and discuss the suggestion, and if approved, it may be assigned for development.

### Before You Proceed to Implement a Feature

> [!TIP]
> Before making a new branch, Make sure to get the latest update from the main branch.
> `git fetch origin`
> `git pull`
> Then create a new branch based on the issue.
> Make sure that you are working on a single problem.
> If you have other concerns, feel free to go to discussions on the GitHub project and make a new discussion.

## PR Guidelines

### Write Small, Focused PRs

- **Keep it Small**: Aim to create small, focused pull requests that fulfill a single purpose.Â [Smaller PRs are easier and faster to review and merge, and they reduce the risk of introducing bugs1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

### Review Your Own PR First

- **Self-Review**: Before submitting, review, build, and test your own pull request.Â [This helps catch errors or typos that you might have missed1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

### Provide Context and Guidance

- **Clear Titles and Descriptions**: Write clear titles and descriptions for your pull requests so that reviewers can quickly understand what the PR does.Â [Include the purpose of the PR, an overview of what changed, and links to any additional context such as tracking issues or previous conversations1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

- **Guidance for Reviewers**: If your PR consists of changes to multiple files, provide guidance to reviewers about the order in which to review the files.Â [Recommend where to start and how to proceed with the review1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

### Use Pull Request Templates

- **Standardize Information**: Use pull request templates to standardize the information included when someone creates a PR in your repository.Â [This can include a list of tasks to complete before merging1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

### Link to Issues

- **Reference Issues**: Include an issue reference in your PR body to automatically close the issue when the PR is merged.Â [This helps keep your project organized1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

### Communicate Clearly

- **Feedback Requests**: Share the type of feedback you need.Â [For example, specify if you need a quick look or a deeper critique1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

- [**Ask Questions**: If youâ€™re unsure about something, ask questions in the PR description to get the necessary feedback from reviewers2](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/).

### Test Thoroughly

- [**Automated and Manual Testing**: Ensure your changes are thoroughly tested, both manually and with automated tests, to catch any potential issues before the PR is reviewed1](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).

> [!TIP]
> For major changes or UI changes, please include a screenshot on how it looks like on your end.
> It'll make the review faster for easier and faster pull merges.
